	<p>Now that you have developed a profile of yourself (Assignment 1), it is time to use this profile to assemble a group, and to show how you can work as a team to produce an HTML report on various aspects of the IT industry.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This assignment is worth 20% of your overall mark.</li>
		<li>This is a group assignment. Each person in the group will receive the same mark, unless there are extenuating circumstances which your group has discussed with the lecturer.</li> 
		<li>Your assignment will be in the form of a basic (non-machine generated) HTML report which is hosted on AWS.</li>
		<li>You are required to use Git in order to manage your group's documents and artefacts, including the assignment submission.</li> 
		<li>You can seek feedback on your report from your tutor at any point during tutorials.</li> 
		<li>You are required to work on this assignment regularly each week, so that you should be writing relevant parts of your report each week within your own files and pushing your changes to the groups Git repository each week (or every few days).</li>
		<li>This assignment should be submitted via Canvas</li>
		<li>Commence work on the Assignment in Week 5 and submit at the end of Week 8. This means that each person is expected to spend 4 x 6 = 24 hours working on this assignment.</li>
