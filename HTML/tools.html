	<h3>Introduction to Information Technology</h3>
	<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
	
	<p>Marks: 20%</p>
	<p>Due Date: End of Week 8 (see Canvas)</p>
	<p>Submission: This is a group submission. See Canvas for details.</p>
	
	<h3>Tools</h3>
	<p>Having set up an individual website using AWS, you should now set up a group website, also on AWS, using the same approach. You should then include hyperlinks to each individual AWS website on the group website.  </p>
	<p>You also need to set up a GitHub repository for your group on which you can use Git. This is to facilitate the production and maintenance of group artefacts, which will include the assignment submission, but may also include other reports or information, code, examples, formatted data, images and videos, links, and similar information. In using Github, we expect that each of you will be working on individual files and that you should be pushing and pulling the files that you work on through your central group repository. Marks will be allocated on your Git usage as per your logs. </p>
	<p>You will also need to set up your group on Canvas. Do this immediately. </p>
	<p>In your HTML-based report, which is on AWS, you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following  </p>
	
	<ul>
  		<li>The link to your group’s Git repository</li>
  		<li>Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. (You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission).</li>
  		<li>A bullet pointed list of web resources that you used to compile your report </li>
	</ul>
