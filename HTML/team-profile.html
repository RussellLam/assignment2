	<h3>Introduction to Information Technology</h3>
	<h3>Initial HTML website setup</h3>
	
	
	<p>Marks: 20%</p>
	<p>Due Date: End of Week 8 (see Canvas)</p>
	<p>Submission: This is a group submission. See Canvas for details.</p>
	
	<h3>Team Profile</h3>
	
	<p>Each of you will have produced a personal profile for Assignment 1. You are to assemble this information, reviewing it as you see fit given your feedback from Assignment 1, to produce a team profile. This should be organised into the following subsections.</p>
	
	<h3>Team Name</h3>
	<p>You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this name will be used to identify your group for the rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that this name could be one that comes to the attention of potential employers.  </p>
	
	<h3>Personal Information</h3>
	<p>One paragraph per person, including name, recent photo student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and IT experience. This should also include your teamâ€™s chosen name.  </p>
	
	<h3>Team Profile</h3>
	<p>The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.  </p>
	
	<h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
	<p>Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?  </p>
