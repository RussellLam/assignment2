	<h3>IT Work</h3>
	
	<p>The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It is also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work.</p>
	
	<p>There are two ways in which you can do this, as below.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Interview an IT professional</li>
		<li>View, summarise and discuss at least 10 recent YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how many hits there are for a search on A day in the life of an IT professional).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a group) interview an IT professional . Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that you will find helpful in the future. If you choose this option, use the questions below as a guide.</p>
	
	
	<ol>
		<li>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</li>
		<li>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</li>
		<li>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</li>
		<li>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</li>
	</ol>
