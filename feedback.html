	<h3>Introduction to Information Technology</h3>
	<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
	
	<p>Marks: 20%</p>
	<p>Due Date: End of Week 8 (see Canvas)</p>
	<p>Submission: This is a group submission. See Canvas for details.</p>
	
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	
	<p>By the time you get to Week 8, you should have been working as a group for three weeks, and hence have some experience of how well the group is working. A key feature of industry teams is the ability to give and receive feedback, particular to members of a team in which you are working.</p>
	
	<p>In the next assignment we will use SparkPLUS as a tool where you give feedback to each other, such that the feedback will affect your individual marks. For this assignment, we will ask each of you to write a paragraph of feedback about the perceived contribution and performance of each member of the group. Therefore, assuming a group consists of A, B, C and D. Then Aâ€™s Feedback section will give 3 paragraphs of feedback about B, C and D. B will give feedback about A, C and Dr etc.</p>
	
	<p>If you have any concerns with this process, please raise these with your tutor or lecturer.</p>
